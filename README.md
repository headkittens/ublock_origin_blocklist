# uBlock Origin blocklist
My ublock origin blocklist for general internet annoyances.
I pared down my built up list for this because websites change and I should be on top of it if something changes, also, just a reminder to keep it commented so I know what's what.

Current sites covered:
- Google accounts
- YouTube
- Fandom
- AliExpress

Future sites:
- ~~X maybe, my list is out of date because I don't use X anymore~~
- Patreon, for their recommendation algorithm
- News sites, especially Guardian for their nag-ads
